# Ch 3 Practice problems

Initialized my own List data type
Initialized my own Tree data type
Initialized my own Direction data type

converse takes a List data type and converts it to a standard List

length' is my own implementation of length

mean' computes the average of a List

turnIntoPalindrome takes a list and converts it into a palindrome by concatentating the reverse of the list to the end

reverse' is my implementation of reversing a List

determineIfPalindrome checks if a list is a palindrome by comparing the first and last elements recursively

sortByLength sorts a list of lists by their length

order' is a ordering function for sortByLength

intersperse' injects an element in between each list in the list of lists and concatenates them together

heightOfTree finds the height of a binary Tree

whatTurn determines the turn given 3 points.

list2Direction produces a list of directions given a list of coordinates

convexHull returns the points for the convex hull

findCoords finds the coordinates of the convex hull given the corresponding list of Directions

removeRedXCoord filters out any coordinates that appear on the same x coordinate and only returns the max and min if there are more than 3

sortAngle sorts a list of Coordinates based on the angle they form to a point

minimumPoint finds the minimum y coordinate point in a list of coordinates

minimumPointOrdering is an ordering function for minimumPoint
